# Review for log cabins from Johnsons Gardens (Polhill)

This page is created to leave a review for Johnsons Gardens Cabin and to share my opinion. 

We had a Garden Cabin installed by Johnsons (Denver, 5x4m). Here is our honest review along with some pictures.

Window Frame Scratch: Today, after the finish of the cabin and when I got home, I observed a scratch/dents on the window frame, likely caused by the unbalanced main door that tends to swing towards the door when opened. Based on the dents, I believe the door was just left to slam against the frame during construction. Better workmanship would have balanced the door and prevented this issue. The technicial visiting at the end confirmed the dent as well.

Using garden clean areas as a tip: Another surprise when I got home today was to see that our recently renovated garden area has become a tip for branches. The construction team decided to tip branches they considered cutting in an area we had recently paid £700 to have cleaned and covered with membrane. This has left the area looking like a tip, and this is all due to lack of communication surrounding their decision. It would have been far more convenient and respectful for them to seek our input on how to handle these branches rather. Now we have to go down and clean the area again and carry all of that from behind the log cabin. Hopefully, what they threw away there hasn’t damaged the membrane.

Cracks in the Wood Used for the Construction:
During the inspection of the garden house, I also noticed several cracks in the wood used for the construction (picture attached). The technician used some wood filler but it definitely looks like a damage made during construction by forcing a screw.

Dirt on the Interior Window Frame:
I was upset to discover significant dirt on the interior window frame of the garden house, which cannot be removed through regular cleaning. Despite attempts of the visiting technician to rectify the issue using a sander, the dirt remains embedded in the wood. Given that we cannot paint the interior, this issue will persist, leaving the window frame in an unsightly condition. I believe that greater care should have been taken during the construction process to prevent such issues.

Dirt on the Piece of Wood Above Windows:
Additionally, there is noticeable dirt on the piece of wood above the windows on the ouside. It appears that this dirt is a result of improper handling of the wood during construction, or perhaps the mounting of these components with dirty hands. Unfortunately, this dirt has become ingrained in the wood. I believe that more attention to detail and cleanliness during the construction process could have prevented this issue from occurring.

Exposure of Garden Room Base: One of the major concerns I had was the complete exposure of the garden room base over the weekend, despite our prior warnings about the dangers of leaving it open. This was due to the delays. As a result, foxes damaged the black membrane. I am concerned about the long-term integrity of the floor, despite them saying they "patched" it.

Unexpected Delay: The construction job took four days, which disrupted our plans for other contractors, specifically painters scheduled for the weekend and an electrician for Monday. What frustrated me further was the lack of timely communication regarding the extended timeline. I only found out about the delay on Friday afternoon, giving me less than 24 hours' notice to cancel the painters, resulting in a loss of a £250 deposit. Everyone "promised" us that it will only take two days and they will send enough people (well, just two).

Underestimating the work: Equally, the entire job was underestimated and not enough workers were assigned to the job. I understand that the company wants to make profits and build as many cabins as possible at the same time but it is not acceptable the experience we had with this construction. Ultimately, it all fell onto us, our work, risking the integrity of the construction, having to call the Logistics team each day and to request that the team comes back and finishes the job.
